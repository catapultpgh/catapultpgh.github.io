<p>To join the community is free, but if you want to work and drink our coffee on regularly we have a few options. Note that these prices will likely go up about 20% in January once we are settled into our new Lawrenceville space.</p>

<p>Being a member of Catapult includes much more than a desk or office. Even with our basic Shared Desk membership, you can enjoy all of the following:</p> 
<ul>
    <li>Community of friendly professionals</li>
    <li>Delicious coffee</li>
    <li>Miscellaneous social events (dollar pints at Arsenal, fine cocktails at Tender)</li>
    <li>Big, beautiful conference room</li>
    <li>A space to host meetups and events</li>
    <li>Free admission to all events at Catapult</li>
</ul>

	<h2>Desks</h2>
	<div class="plan sixcol first">
		<h4>Shared Desk <br />$50/mo</h4>
		<a class="button first">Sign up</a>
		<p>With a shared desk, you can sit wherever you like. In the unlikely event we have a packed house, you'll have to double up with someone. This plan includes delicious coffee but no key (at least during the beta period).</p>
	</div>
	<div class="plan sixcol last">
		<h4>Permanent Desk <br />$150/mo</h4>
		<a class="button first">Sign up</a>
		<p>If you want to claim a desk as your very own, set up a monitor, leave your crap all over the place, the permanent desk plan is for you. We have a few gigantic cubicle-esque desks, as well as more basic Ikea options, that are waiting for you and your stuff.</p>

	<h2>Offices</h2>
	<p>We also have five offices available ranging from small, 2 or 3 person rooms, to larger offices that would fit 5 or more people. The offices are currently rented out, but we can certainly add you to a waiting list.</p>

	<div class="plan fourcol first">
		<h4>Small, 120sq feet <br />$250/mo</h4>
		<a class="button first">Get on the waiting list</a>
		<p>We have two smaller offices available that fit two or three people nicely.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="plan fourcol">
		<h4>Medium, 140sq feet <br />$350/mo</h4>
		<a class="button first">Get on the waiting list</a>
		<p>This office would comfortably fit 3 or 4 desks and is complete with a nice window.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="plan fourcol last">
		<h4>Large, 160sq feet <br />$450/mo</h4>
		<a class="button first">Get on the waiting list</a>
		<p>We have two large offices. They are super nice with wooden floors and lots of natural light. Comfortably fits 4-6 desks.</p>

	<h2>Host an event</h2>
	<p>We are happy to provide our space for community events. All we ask is that you clean up after yourself and allow Catapult members to attend for free.</p>
