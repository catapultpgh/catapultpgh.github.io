            <h1 class="tagline">Welcome to Catapult, a Co√∂perative Creative Agency.</h1>
            <p class="h3">Want the personal touch of a freelancer but the skillset of an agency?</p>

                    <p>We are a creative agency of independent people who choose to work together on interesting projects. Working with us is a bit different. Projects start with building a team that suits your needs and not the other way around. Want a WordPress website with hand illustrations, we team you with a web designer and an artist. Need a video, we've got someone who does that too. We come to work because we like working together, not because we're getting paid to, and now we're finding interesting ways to work together more often.</p>

                    <p>Greg is a jack-of-all-trades software developer who enjoys writing 
                        beautiful code. He spends most of his time on back- and front-end web 
                        development, but he's been known to dabble in other domains, such as mobile 
                        apps and scientific computing. In addition to his freelance work at Catapult,
                        he is currently exploring the intersection of autism education and technology
                        with researchers at Carnegie Mellon University. He hates the fact that this
                        site is PHP-powered, but hasn't gotten around to changing that quite yet.</p>
