<p>Just wanted to let everyone know that I just signed a two year lease. That means Catapult is here to stay. We're at 5139 Penn ave (a few doors down from People's) and will be opening our doors January 1st. Get excited! I'm going to be updating this website throughout the month, but right now there's only one plan: $150 and you get a key and a permanent desk. Everything else is TBA so stay tuned.</p>
