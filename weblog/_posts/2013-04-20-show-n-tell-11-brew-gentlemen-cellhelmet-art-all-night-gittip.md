Ok everyone, guess what? Another great crew for Show-n-Tell - no way, yes way! Come by Friday April 5, 5pm, 5139 Penn to experience the magic.

A quick note on timing: starting this month, our doors are open at 5 and **presenters will start at 6pm sharp**. Hopefully that will work better for everyone coming straight from work. Enough with logistics, who will be speaking this month?

<br />
[The Brew Gentlemen Beer Co.](http://brewgentlemen.com) is an experimental startup microbrewery located in the historic steel town of Braddock, PA. Founded in 2010 by Carnegie Mellon students Matt Katase and Asa Foster, the brewery is slated to open in late 2013. The Brew Gentlemen will be producing a unique line of beers that will rely heavily on non-traditional ingredients and focus on collaboration.

Michael Kane jumped into the entrepreneurial world immediately after graduating from the University of Pittsburgh in 2005 - he never had interest in a typical "career."  While he has met many road blocks along the way, he has always persevered with the attitude that "anything is possible, if you're willing to put in the hard work."  This was proven true in mid 2012, when his persistence paid off, landed his company "cellhelmet" a spot on ABC's hit television show Shark Tank.  The show has since been a valuable marketing tool, exposing the brand to over 7 million viewers. [cellhelmet](http://cellhelmet.com) also managed to score an investment within 1 month of filming the show, from 2 individuals who own the majority of the Verizon indirect retailers in Pittsburgh, PA.  

The cellhelmet company recently signed on with 3 distributors and cellhelmet products are now in motion to sit on over 1,000 shelves by the summer of 2013.  Each cellhelmet case comes with 1 year of accidental damage coverage - break a device inside and the company will repair or replace it.  cellhelmet Screen Protectors were announced in 2012 and they're now available for most smart phones.

##Gittip

<br />
[Gittip](http://gittip.com) is a way to give small weekly cash gifts to people you love and are inspired by. Gifts are weekly. The intention is for people to depend on money received through Gittip in order to pay their bills, and bills are recurring. Gifts come with no strings attached. You don't know exactly where your gifts come from, and the maximum gift from one person to another is $24. Gifts are public. The total amount you give and the total amount you receive is public. Participants on both sides of the equation are rewarded publicly for their participation. [Chad Whitacre](https://twitter.com/whit537) Gittip's founder will be speaking.
