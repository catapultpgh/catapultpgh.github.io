Great turnout at Show-n-Tell #3 on July 6, at <a href="http://catapultPGH.org">CatpultPGH </a>in Garfield/Friendhip. About 25 people got out of the heat and into some sweet AC to learn, connect, and share.

Bill Peduto (above) discussed population growth and loss in various parts of Pittsburgh over the last 10 years. Peduto discussed three powerful items that could contribute to a more vibrant Pittsburgh: Repurposing unused train tracks for public transportation, enhancing Pittsburgh's urban forest to mitigate the need for a new sewage drainage mega-tunnel, and encouraging the growth of an industry that designs and builds affordable, modular, green housing units.
