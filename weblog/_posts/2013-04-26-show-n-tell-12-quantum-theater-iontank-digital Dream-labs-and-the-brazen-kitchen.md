It's the **one year anniversary** of Show-n-Tell at Catapult! Maybe a cake to celebrate? Let's throw a quick thank you at [Jonny Goldstein](http://www.jonnygoldstein.com) for starting the event. Per usual, come by Friday May 3, 5pm, 5139 Penn to experience the magic. Presenters at 6pm sharp. Introducing:

## Karla Boos: [Quantum Theater](http://quantumtheatre.org)

<br /><br />
[Quantum Theater](http://quantiumtheatre.org) Quantum Theatre, run by its founder Karla Boos, creates adventurous, environmental productions of plays all over the city of Pittsburgh. Original works, contemporary international plays or updated classics are brought intimately close in settings like groves of trees, abandoned mills, grand museums, or empty swimming pools . The plays unite directors, performers, and designers from all over the world with Pittsburgh’s most talented artists.

## Rob de la Cretaz: [IonTank](http://iontank.com)

<br /><br />
[IonTank](http://iontank.com) develops interactive experiences from design and concept all the way up to code, interface and fabrication.  We put together years of experience in hardware hacking, software mastery and logistics to solve problems for marketing and art, and you'll find our work all around the country in trade shows, museums and traveling interactive devices. 

We'll be showing off our latest creation, the PixelWall, and the process that took us from prototype to a thirty foot long wall made of hard work and switchable glass."

[Digital Dream Labs](http://digitaldreamlabs.com) is a startup based in Pittsburgh, PA creating a brand new toy to tablet learning platform, called dreamWare. Our first game for dreamWare teaches logic and sequencing--the basis for understanding computer programming. The Pilot Program, just announced, will give 25 participants the opportunity to own the experience before anyone else in Summer 2013. Digital Dream Labs was founded by 3 graduates of Carnegie Mellon's Entertainment Technology Center and now resides at AlphaLab, a tech accelerator in Pittsburgh's South Side.
