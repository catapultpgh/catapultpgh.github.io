<p>This month's Show-n-Tell has shaped up to be an excellent one (as usual!). Come to Catapult at 5pm Feb 1 and enjoy the genius of:</p>
<h2>Jonny Goldstein: ExoSkeleta</h2>
<p>&nbsp; <img src="http://notlaura.com/images/catapult/jonny.jpeg" alt="The ingenious, Jonny Goldstein!" /></p>
<p>The founder of Show-n-Tell, our very own Jonny will be previewing ideas and visuals for his incubating 1-man show, ExoSkeleta.</p>
<p>ExoSkeleta looks at the human condition through the prism of one of nature's finest creations, the exoskeleton.</p>
<p>No idea what that means, but it sounds fantastic!A bit about Jonny: Jonny helps people explain stuff by drawing pictures of their ideas. More Jonny stuff at http://envizualize.com.</p>
<h2>Mike Capsambelis: Founder, Awesome Pittsburgh</h2>
<p>&nbsp;<img src="http://notlaura.com/images/catapult/mike.jpeg" alt="Mike Capsambelis" /></p>
<p>Mike co-founded Awesome Pittsburgh in 2011 to get money into the hands of people with brilliant ideas with no strings attached. Awesome Pittsburgh believes that Pittsburgh, with all of the resources and amenities that drive us to the top of most of the "Best city..." lists, can bring more awesomeness to the global community. And we give $1000 each month to the people who show us the best ways to do that. We've funded projects ranging from a floating art venue and a puppet photo booth to an outdoor classroom and fluoride treatments for kids. In addition to highlighting some of these projects, Mike will talk about the impetus behind Awesome Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>Mike's day job is working in product management at Google and collaborating with the company's Entrepreneurial Outreach team to find ways to support the local startup and small business communities. He also serves on the board of Uptown Partners, trying to bring a little awesomeness to one of the city's hidden neighborhood gems.</p>
<h2>Adam Nelson and Lindsey Dill: We Are Here</h2>
<p>&nbsp; <img src="http://notlaura.com/images/catapult/wearehere.jpg" alt="We Are Here" width="500" /></p>
<p>We Are Here is a project to connect citizens with "Third Places," natural community gathering places that create a sense of belonging and encourage community engagement. We Are Here connects physical and virtual communities through an online map of Pittsburgh Third Places, and colorful wayfinding signs that lead citizens to them. By guiding citizens to a Third Place in a nearby neighborhood, We Are Here leads strangers to a place where they are welcomed as friends, and invited to be a part of the community.</p>
<p>We Are Here builds on the documentary work of Lindsay Dill, a local photojournalist who has been photographing and blogging about Third Places around the city, including the Frick Park Market in Point Breeze, Brew on Broadway in Beechview, Market Square in Downtown, and 720 Music, Clothing, and Cafe in Lawrenceville. By encouraging citizens to walk to these and other Third Places via playful wayfinding signs, We Are Here also integrates elements of the "Walk [Your City]" project and the City of Play.</p>
<h2>Nicole Antonuccio: DahnTahn Abby</h2>
<p>&nbsp;<img src="http://notlaura.com/images/catapult/abby.jpg" alt="dahntahn abby" /></p>
<p>Dahntahn Abby is a character created and played by Nicole Antonuccio. The character will be featured in a live show, "Dahntahn Abby LIVE" as well as a fake documentary video project to be aired online called "The Dahntahn Abby DOC" (title subject to change).  The live show, produced by Nicole Antonuccio and Connor Mrozowski, is an improvised talk show that will include audience interviews, video footage, news segments, and a special guest.</p>
<p>Connor and Nicole have spent the last two months workshopping the character and creating the format of the live show.  They are pleased to announce that the first show will be Saturday, February 9th at 10pm at the <a href="http://steelcityimprov.com" target="blank">Steel City Improv Theater</a>. There will be questions, answers and maybe some chipped chopped ham!</p>
