<a href="http://www.ericsinger.com/">Eric Singer</a> is an an artist in the oldest and newest mediums you can imagine: fire, music, and robots. I met Eric in 2004 in New York City when he gave me advice as I worked to create a set of electronics embedded coveralls I used as an audio controller for comedy performance. Since then we have both relocated to the Steel City. Eric recently spearheaded the East Coast's first festival dedicated entirely to fire art, <a href="http://pyrotopia.net/">Pyrotopia</a> in Munhall, PA. Prior to that Eric founded LEMUR, the League of Electronic Muscal Urban Robots. "LEMUR creates exotic, sculptural musical instruments which integrate robotic technology. The result is computer-controlled mechanized acoustic musical instruments which can perform music by and with human musicians." Eric's creative resume is too long to enumerate here, just know that he is a creative rockstar (literally---he used to play sax in the celebrated ska band the Allstonians).

Rebecca Harris is the director of the Chatham <a href="http://www.chatham.edu/cwe/">Center for Women's Entrepreneurship</a>. Harris is "…passionate about helping women start and grow successful businesses, Ms. Harris has expertise in developing strategic alliances and mentoring opportunities which will benefit women working in local and regional businesses." She has had a long and varied career starting and running numerous businesses. I heard her giving a shout out to CatapultPGH on the WESA talkshow Essential Pittsburgh, and I figured if she is tuned in enough to know about us, she must be good people. And since we are comprised of a variety of entrepreneurial individuals and companies, we would love to hear about resources for Pittsburgh based entrepreneurs.

Anne Marie Toccket and Nick Fedorek are part of the team behind the <a href="http://pittsburghhostel.org/">Pittsburgh Hostel Project.</a> "The Pittsburgh Hostel Project is a group of people who believe Pittsburgh can and should sustain a hostel and are dedicated to making this happen."

Anne Marie is the project Director and a Jane of all trades. She holds three bachelor’s degrees from Penn State University and a master’s degree in international development and nonprofit management from the University of Pittsburgh. Anne Marie works remotely for Awamaki, a nonprofit that she cofounded in Peru dedicated to sustainable development. She is co-owner of a cooperative bookstore/cafe in Pittsburgh, and chair of the board of Building New Hope, an international nonprofit based in Pittsburgh that imports fair-trade  coffee.  She was chosen as a delegate to the 2012 One Young World summit held in Pittsburgh.  She has extensive experience in nonprofit fundraising and program development, and loves international travel–she has been to 40 countries and counting.

Nick Gunther Fedorek has been part of the Pittsburgh Hostel Project for about 4 months. He has stayed at many, many hostels on backpacking trips throughout Europe, and thinks it's about time Pittsburgh had a hostel of its own. He recently finished his master's degree in Community Development and Planning and is involved with the planning, development, and community process components of the project. He is currently a freelancer specializing in qualitative research, market analysis, and business development.

Derek Minto is a Pittsburgh based comedian, storyteller, and the host of the Haters for Hire comedy podcast. "Haters for Hire is a weekly audio podcast chock full of swearing, stand up comics, and game show style violence all hosted by Derek Minto. Each week features new guests, stories and discussions. A majority of the time the guests are comics from the city of Pittsburgh though many hail from all over country." A recent tweet of Derek's "If only there was Taco flavored vodka...oh wait that's tequila."

Besides our lineup of fabulous guests, we are mixing up some of the other roles. Lara Schenck will emcee, Elliot Williams will be capturing the conversations with large scale visual notes, and I (Jonny Goldstein) will open and close the event and be the official photographer.
