Show-n-Tell number 10, again, fantastic! As usual, RSVP on the [Facebook event](https://www.facebook.com/events/475037322549554/). This month, March 1 at 5pm, come see:

##Wigle Whiskey
![Wigle Whiskey](http://notlaura.com/images/catapult/wigle.png)
Wigle is named for a good-natured man who was sentenced to hang for his unsinkable love of whiskey. In 1794, Phillip Wigle defended his right to distill in a tussle with a tax collector. He unwittingly helped spark the Whiskey Rebellion, which pitted Pennsylvania distillers against George Washington's troops.

[Wigle Whiskey](http://wiglewhiskey.com) is working to restore a Pennsylvania tradition championed by these rebellious distillers. We make spirits much the same way Wigle and his friends did â€“ in small batches, with a copper pot and local ingredients.

Co-founders Eric Meyer and Meredith Grelli will be the speakers, read more about them [here](https://www.wiglewhiskey.com/cast-of-characters).

##Steel City Improv Theater

Justin is the co-founder of [Steel City Improv Theater](http://steelcityimprov.com) (The SCIT) in Shadyside.  He acts as the Education Director of the SCIT's improv training program.  Justin will explain how improv took him from New York City actor and theater administrator to improv entrepreneur in Pittsburgh.

##Megabits
![Megabits App](http://notlaura.com/images/catapult/megabits.png)
MegaBits is a massively multiplayer online (MMO) game based on your physical location. It allows you to catch, train, and battle monsters found in different areas in the real world. We want adventure. And what better place to have that adventure than in the real world? Your location in MegaBits is your location in real life. Trainers near you appear right on your map.

You might find different wild MegaBits depending on where you are in the world, what time of day it is, and even the weather. You can search for the rarest MegaBits, or trade to collect them from every region in the world. You can feed and play with your MegaBits to keep them happy, or you can battle them against other trainers from anywhere. No matter what your play style, you too can become a MegaBits legend.

##Three Rivers Village School
